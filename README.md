# E08a-Paddle-Ball
This is the first Godot exercise for BL-MSCH-C220. 

In this exercise, I used Godot to add notes to a scene to create a basic paddle game. I created nodes to indicate the walls, paddles and ball and then created collision nodes to alert the game that the ball should collide with the wall and paddle when it comes into contact with their sprites. I also added script to indicate the paddle can move following the mouse movement. I also used child nodes within godot to complete the project.
